    "With the accelerating popularity of online educational experiences, the role of online lectures and other educational video continues to increase in scope and importance. Open access educational repositories such as videolectures.net, as well as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on platforms like Coursera, have made access to many thousands of lectures and tutorials an accessible option for millions of people around the world. Yet this impressive volume of content has also led to a challenge in how to find, filter, and match these videos with learners. This assignment gives you an example of how machine learning can be used to address part of that challenge."

    "One critical property of a video is engagement: how interesting or \"engaging\" it is for viewers, so that they decide to keep watching. Engagement is critical for learning, whether the instruction is coming from a video or any other source. There are many ways to define engagement with video, but one common approach is to estimate it by measuring how much of the video a user watches. If the video is not interesting and does not engage a viewer, they will typically abandon it quickly, e.g. only watch 5 or 10% of the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first step towards providing the best-matching educational content is to understand which features of educational material make it engaging for learners in general. This is where predictive modeling can be applied, via supervised machine learning. For this assignment, your task is to predict how engaging an educational video is likely to be for viewers, based on a set of features extracted from the video's transcript, audio track, hosting site, and other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this prediction problem for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines a variety of features derived from a rich set of resources connected to the original data;\n",
    "The manageable dataset size means the dataset and supervised models for it can be easily explored on a wide variety of computing platforms;\n",
    "Predicting popularity or engagement for a media item, especially combined with understanding which features contribute to its success with viewers, is a fun problem but also a practical representative application of machine learning in a number of business and educational sectors."

Each row in these two files corresponds to a single educational video, and includes information about diverse properties of the video content as described further below. The target variable is engagement which was defined as True if the median percentage of the video watched across all viewers was at least 30%, and False otherwise.\n",

    "Note: Any extra variables that may be included in the training set are simply for your interest if you want an additional source of data for visualization, or to enable unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. However, they are not included in the test set and thus cannot be used for prediction.\n",

    "For this final assignment, you will bring together what you've learned across all four weeks of this course, by exploring different prediction models for this new dataset. In addition, we encourage you to apply what you've learned about model selection to do hyperparameter tuning using training/validation splits of the training data, to optimize the model and further increase its performance. In addition to a basic evaluation of model accuracy, we've also provided a utility function to visualize which features are most and least contributing to the overall model performance."
